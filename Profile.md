## Project Name
Evolutive skin disease detection using partial reconfiguration

## Project Description (max 500 words)
Each year an enormous number of people die from skin diseases.
Based on BSD Work Group and the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) there is 85 million US patient were diagnosed with at least one skin disease in 2013 (25% of the US population).
According to a study in 2016 from the “French society of dermatology” 16 million French suffer from a skin disease, and 80% of those suffer from more than 1 pathology which makes 24% of the French population.
Referring to the article “The burden of skin disease in the United States” in the journal of the AAD, 24 different categories of skin pathologies can be identified each one including at least 4 diseases. Using this approximation, there is a minimum of 100 diseases.
With this huge number of diseases, it implies pronostic more difficult to establish for doctors.
At this point the early detection of any skin disease might reduce the death’s risk, by assuring the appropriate diagnosis in order to provide the right treatment.
 
Here comes the interest of autonomous systems to help doctors around the world to identify accuratly skin diseases.
A faster diagnosis may prevents the patients large treatment durations that can be avoided.
